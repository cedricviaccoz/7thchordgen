# 7thchordgen
Just a samll C program to train myself into learning chords.
Once you run the program, you juste have to press a key, then it will dictate you to play a random chord
for example a Cmin7 with the bass on the 5th string.
Once you've played that chord you can press enter key and the program will show you the solution as a simplified ASCII output of a chord diagram.

#The chords
The chords you are required to play have three variables :
1. the base (tonique) (all twelve note from A to G with semi-tones)
2. the string in wich the bass (tonique) has to be played (4th, 5th, or 6th string)
3. and the chord itself, the choices are the following :
..* Maj7
..* 7
..* m7 (-7)
..* m7b5 (%)
..* diminished/diminué (°)
