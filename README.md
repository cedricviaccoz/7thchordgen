#7thchordgen
A small C program to help you learn jazz chords.

##Instructions
1. Run the program and press enter.
2. You will be told to play a random chord (e.g. a Cmin7 with the bass on the 5th string).
3. Press enter after you play the chord and the program will output a solution (a chord diagram) in ASCII.

##The chords
The chords you are required to play have three variables:
* the base (tonique) (all twelve notes from A to G with semi-tones)
* the string in which the bass (tonique) has to be played (4th, 5th, or 6th string)
* and the chord itself, the choices are the following:
  * Maj7
  * 7
  * m7 (-7)
  * m7b5
  * diminished/diminué (°)
